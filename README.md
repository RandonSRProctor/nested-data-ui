# Nested Data UI

**An interactive UI to represented hierarchal data structures**

## Abstration of Nodes

A Node is an abstraction describing the point where two items in a system meet.

This project is specifically focused on visually traversing nested data-stucrues, so following the movements from node to node will be an important way of understanding the paradigm.

Because a node is a dimensionless point, it is must be defined by its two joined components. In a heirarchal system these points can be called The Parent and The Child

1. The Parent
2. The Children

In Javascript, we often lump these hierarchal data structures into two catgories: Objects and Arrays. The two parts of the node would be:

1. Key (or Index of an Array)
2. Value

Each node in this project is visually represented by a Card.
